# Profile Card Component

This project demonstrates a responsive **Profile Card** component built with HTML and CSS, featuring an interactive layout and hover effects. The card is designed to display a user's image, name, skills, and a brief description with a call-to-action button for more information. It is styled using custom CSS properties and modern web design techniques.

## Features

- **Profile Picture**: Displays a user’s profile picture with a hover effect.
- **Skills Section**: Showcases the user’s skills (TypeScript, React, Vue) with links to their respective websites.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout and styling based on screen size, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects for skills and the card itself.
- **Customizable**: Easily change colors and styles by modifying CSS variables.

## CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

The design uses a set of CSS custom properties (variables) for easy customization:

```css
:root {

  --vue: #42b883;
  --white: #fff;
  --background: #f8f8ff;
  --text: #262626;
